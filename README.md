## Description

The purpose in creating this application was to allow users to publish articles, blog posts, and their thoughts/opinions about certain tech topics.
Using this platform, users will be able to create/edit/delete blog posts as well as comment on other people's posts once they are registered and logged in.
The user will also be automatically logged out after his/her session expires.

If you would like to see my tech blog, please use the link [here](https://lunirs-techblog.herokuapp.com/).

Future improvements would be the efficiency of the website. Currently, the website malfunctions sometimes due to some issue with cookies.

If the dashboard does not show up for you, please go into inpector -> application -> delete cookie.
